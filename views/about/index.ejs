    Song Check is a CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) application that serves as a platform to connect all music lovers.
    <br>
    When interacting with our app as a guest, you can view a list of all the songs created by our users and view more information 
    <br>
    about the song along with its reviews. If you notice you enjoy a user's music taste you can find 
    <br>
    all of their specifically added songs by searching for the user and viewing their playlist.
